    <h3 id="whatisit">What is it?</h3>
    <p>Red Remote Protocol is an open protocol developed by Felipe Durar that provides remote access to a computer with Graphical Interface 
        over the network sharing basic human interface devices such as mouse and keyboard and providing file transfer.</p>
    <p>It is layered on top of the WebSocket protocol since it provides full-duplex communication channels over TCP with minimal framing, the data sent through 
        the websocket are json encoded payload data as it will be described later.</p>
    <p>More information about the WebSocket can be found at the RFC6455 provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force at 
        <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455</a></p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Be as simple as possible:</b> The design philosophy of the protocol is that it could be simple enough to use basic features 
            from other languages and even browsers to create client applications without having to deal with complex streaming or networking algothms and protocols,
            it also would provide a much easier code maintenance and a shorter learning curve for who's never saw the code earlier and wants to create a remote access client.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Performance:</b> In order to keep the protocol simplicity some drawbacks were accepted what can sacrifice the performance of client applications running 
            this protocol.
            <br>
            For example, instead of using more consolidated and popular video streaming protocols the RRP send a framesegment (will be discussed later) packets that
            just represents the changed screen area, it is basically an image and the rectangle describing where it should be rendered. The image is compressed using some 
            picture format (such as JPEG or PNG), converted to base64 and them added into the json payload.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</h3>
    <p>Red Remote protocol was designed to be used with a central server which intermediates the socket connections between the clients providing 
        several features such as authentication control, payload data validation among other things. Both the machine that is being controlled as well as 
        the machine who is controlling the remote computer runs a client application as it is show in the picture below.</p>
